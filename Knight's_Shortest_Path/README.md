KNIGHTâ€™S SHORTEST PATH USING DIJKSTRA 
ALGORITHM 
<br>
The shortest path problem in computer science and graph theory is a classic 
optimization problem. It involves finding the minimum-length path between two nodes 
(or vertices) in a graph, where the length is defined by the sum of the edge weights along 
the path.
